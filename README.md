# WYS_ARG_GPU_brufeforcer
This is a subproject for already existing [ARG toolchain](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e_nOhSkTh9cchh8n5yDadvf-pnoi8CBZnHwZE0dsbcI). 

The goal is to write a program that helps solving the binary puzzle by utilising power of the GPU (more info about binary puzzle can be found in the [ARG document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e_nOhSkTh9cchh8n5yDadvf-pnoi8CBZnHwZE0dsbcI))
## Tech
GPU bruteforcer is written in [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) using [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu) library and uses [wgsl](https://www.w3.org/TR/WGSL/) for compute shaders
